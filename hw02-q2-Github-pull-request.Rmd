This is Homework 2, Question 2. Presumably you have already cloned the repo <https://github.com/bmacGTPM/361-Spring-2023> in order to get this file. Create a new branch and name it your first and last name. Make an edit to this R Markdown file `hw2-q2-Github-pull-request.Rmd` to have your name at the top instead of mine, and the current date instead of Jan 15, 2023. Commit that to your branch, push those commits to Github, and create a pull-request to the `main` branch. For help getting started, see <https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop>.
